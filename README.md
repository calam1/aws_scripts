#### aws_scripts

#####Created convenience bash scripts to do some basic AWS CLI commands.  

As of now we have the following directories:
* groups - explanation of group and user creation for new AWS accounts and some scripts that do some group and user management

Also contains sample code in either python or nodejs
* many of these are just tutorials from AWS
